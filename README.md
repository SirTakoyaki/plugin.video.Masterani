# plugin.video.Masterani
Same Masterani as here: https://github.com/SirTakoyaki/Masterani, except zipped for Git Browser

This version uses Masterani's API in order to find shows.
WilsonMagic updated this addon to use a scraper and implemented some other fixes too. 
Check it out at https://github.com/WilsonMagic/Masterani-Redux

I higly recommend switching to it as this current version no longer works properly and will not longer be maintained; Wilson's version is far ahead with its fixes so please use it instead.
